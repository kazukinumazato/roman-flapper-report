Based on design studies and focus groups, we created a prototype of a social drone with a social shape, face and voice for human interaction. We used the prototype for a proxemic study, comparing the required distance from the drone humans could comfortably accept compared with what they would require for a nonsocial drone. The social shaped design with greeting voice added decreased the acceptable distance markedly, as did present or previous pet ownership, and maleness. We also explored the proximity sphere around humans with a social shaped drone based on a validation study with variation of lateral distance and heights. Both lateral distance and the higher height of 1.8 m compared to the lower height of 1.2 m decreased the required comfortable distance as it approached.},

abstract = {Personal drones are becoming more mainstream and are used for a variety of tasks, such as delivery and photography. The exposed blades in conventional drones raise serious safety concerns. To address this, commercial drones have been moving towards a safe-to-touch design or have increased safety by adding propeller guards. The affordances of safe-to-touch drones enable new types of touch-based human-drone interaction. Various applications have been explored, such as augmented sports and haptic feedback in virtual reality; however, it is unclear if individuals feel comfortable using direct touch and manipulation when interacting with safe-to-touch drones. A previous elicitation study showed how users naturally interact with drones. We replicated this study with an unsafe and a safe-to-touch drone, to find out if participants will instinctively use touch as a means of interacting with the safe-to-touch drone. We found that 58\% of the participants used touch, and across all tasks 39\% of interactions were touch-based. The proposed touch interactions were in agreement for 67\% of the tasks, and users reported that interacting with the safe-to-touch drone was significantly less mentally demanding than the unsafe drone.},

abstract = {Aerial robots such as quadrotors enjoy ever-increasing popularity and emerge in everyday applications that require user interaction. At immediate proximity, physical control of the quadrotor by touch may be desired or even necessary. In this paper we present a tactile 3D touch interaction scenario with a quadrotor by introducing virtual buttons whose operation is detected in the accelerometer data of the built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) of the quadrotor. By dispensing with additional sensors, we are able to keep the size of the used quadrotor to a minimum and thus address the problem of users being discouraged from interaction with quadrotors at immediate proximity. As an example for the proposed interaction scenario, we introduce MetroDrone, a quadrotor responding to repeated user taps to virtually defined buttons by flying trajectories according to the beat and operated button. This introduces a minimalist interaction technique that requires no intermediary devices and strengthens human-robot connections through shared musical experience.},

abstract = {Balls are the most popular equipment for sports. To play with balls, certain physical methods, or "vocabularies," such as throwing, hitting, spinning, or kicking have been developed by reflecting the fact that balls obey physical dynamics. This feature forms the foundation of ball-based sports; however, we consider that it limits the possibility of such sports. For instance, the speed of balls could be considerably fast for small children, senior people, or people with physical disabilities. In this paper, we propose a flying ball based on quadcopter technology. This ball has the ability hover and to change its location and behavior based on the context of the sport or game. With this technology, the physical dynamics of a ball can be re-programmed by sports designers, and new ball-playing vocabularies, such as hovering, anti-gravity, proximity, or remote manipulation, can be introduced to extend the method in which people interact with balls. In this paper, we introduce this concept as a method of augmenting sports, and present our initial flying ball system that consists of a grid shell that comprises a micro quadcopter, and demonstrates new sports interactions with the ball.},

abstract = {Head-mounted displays for virtual reality (VR) provide high-fidelity visual and auditory experiences. Other modalities are currently less supported. Current commercial devices typically deliver tactile feedback through controllers the user holds in the hands. Since both hands get occupied and tactile feedback can only be provided at a single position, research and industry proposed a range of approaches to provide richer tactile feedback. Approaches, such as tactile vests or electrical muscle stimulation, were proposed, but require additional body-worn devices. This limits comfort and restricts provided feedback to specific body parts. With this Interactivity installation, we propose quadcopters to provide tactile stimulation in VR. While the user is visually and acoustically immersed in VR, small quadcopters simulate bumblebees, arrows, and other objects hitting the user. The user wears a VR headset, mini-quadcopters, controlled by an optical marker tracking system, are used to provide tactile feedback.},

abstract = {Somaesthetics - motivated by improving life quality via appreciation for bodily and sensory experiences - is increasingly influencing HCI designs. Investigating the potential of drones as a material for somaesthetic HCI, we designed Drone Chi: a Tai Chi-inspired close-range human-drone interaction experience. The design process for Drone Chi has been informed by the soma design approach and the Somaesthetic Appreciation concept from HCI literature. The artifact expands somaesthetic HCI by exemplifying dynamic and intimate somaesthetic interactions with a robotic design material, and body movements in expansive 3D space. To characterize the Drone Chi experience, we conducted an empirical study with 32 participants. Analysis of participant accounts revealed 4 themes that articulate different aspects of the experience: Looping Mental States, Environment, Agency vs. Control, and Physical Narratives. From these accounts and our craft knowledge, we derive 5 design implications to guide the development of movement-based close-range drone interactions.},

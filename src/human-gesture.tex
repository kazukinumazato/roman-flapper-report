\section{HUMAN GESTURE}

In this section, we propose a human gesture recognition system for the interaction system.
To achieve anytime, anywhere ignition of the palm landing motion, we need to consider a simple and intuitive gesture that can be easily recognized.
Looking back on falconry, falconers streach their arm horizontally to use it as a landing port for the bird.
In other words, they switch the state of the bird from flying to landing by changing the relative position of the arm to the chest.
Inspired by this, we devide the drone states in midair into two: STAY and APPROACH,
and trigger the transition between them by the user's arm gesture.
To detect this gesture, we only need to measure the distance between the user's hand and chest.
The specific distance threshold is shown in section~\ref{sec:trajectory}\ref{sec:innermost}.

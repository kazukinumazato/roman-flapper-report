\section{CONCLUSIONS}

In this paper, we proposed a falconer-like palm landing system for flapping robot based on different perspectives of users' safety.
We demonstrated that the proposed method can generate a safe and smooth trajectory for the drone to approach a user's palm while avoiding collisions and maintaining a safe distance.
Further research should be done on users' subjective evaluation of the psychological impact of the drone's motion.
To achieve complete human-friendly interaction, we need to consider not only the safety but also the psychological comfortableness of the user.
We believe this work is a step toward the realization of the society where drones and humans can coexist in harmony without any frustration.

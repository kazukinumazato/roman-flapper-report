Flapping-wing drones have attracted significant attention due to their biomimetic flight, with numerous studies focusing on their wing structure and control methods. 
Compared to propeller-driven drones, flapping-wing drones are considered more human-friendly, making them suitable for human-drone interactions. 
However, few studies have explored the practical interaction between humans and flapping-wing drones. 
In this study, we propose an interaction system in which a flapping-wing drone performs a perching motion on a human hand. 
To achieve a safe approach toward humans, we design a trajectory planning method that considers both physical and psychological human factors. 
We implement this trajectory and conduct experiments to evaluate the systemâ€™s performance, including success rate and user perception. 
The results demonstrate that our approach enables safe and effective perching interactions. 
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate physical contact interactions between humans and flapping-wing drones.
